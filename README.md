## Tech Stack

* **Python:** Version 3.10

* **PyTorch**: Version 2.0.1+cu118

* **Google Colab**: Version FREE


## Details

* This code mainly uses the CNN module from **CNN Explainer (Tiny VGG)** and I followed the **Pytorch in 1 day** course.
* There are 3 main images I would like to share, the loss, accuracy, confusion matrix and some prediction samples.

## With 50 epochs running on the GPU, it took total time of 1858.9 Seconds using Google Colab, by the way I still do not know why Test loss is increasing after decreasing.

## As we see it is pretty good, however, I was wondering why shirts are mixed with T-shirts so I looked at the dataset and I found that I as a human got confused as well, as the properties are not very different. Other than that, I think it is good.

## Some predictions and it confuses between T-shirts and shirts

## The Exact Result
 **Epoch: 48** <br>
**Train Loss: 0.0130  | Train Accuracy : 0.9961**
<br>
**Test Loss: 0.4184  | Test Accuracy : 0.9212**
<br>
**==== The Total Time is: 1858.9 Sec  =======**
